Swing | The force is strong with this one
========
Swing is a platform that can be controlled by simply moving your hands in a three dimensional space.
The Force, how does it work?
---------
An aluminium plate plays the role of a capacitor linked to an Arduino Uno that provides current and voltage. When a hand electrically couples with the plate the capacitance changes.
The Arduino computes the duration for the plate to fully charge which gives the position of the hand. Using three plates enables the modeling of the XYZ space.
The droids we are looking for
--------
The processing sketch gives a bright idea of how it works. Note that the serial port and serial monitor values should be changed to match with each user.
The Empire strikes back
---------
This enables the user to swing the land of the enemy by moving the hand.
Two servos were used to move a platform controlled by the aluminium capacitors interface.
